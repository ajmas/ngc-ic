Catalogue Fields Names & Definitions
====================================

- **N** Catalogue N = N (NGC) or N = I (IC)
- **NI** catalogue number . Some objects have an extension letter (A,B,C,...).
- **A** Extension letter: A, B, C...
- **C** Components. If two or more different objects use the same NGC- or IC-number, these are numbered as components (1,2,3,...). This is also applied for objects associated with the main entry.
- **D** Dreyer Object. A * marks, that this is the object which is ment in Dreyer's catalogue (many objects with extension letters are not in the original NGC/IC).
- **S** Status. Status of the identification (see Tab. 2)
- **P** Precision. Flag for high precision position
- **CON** Constellation
- **RH, RM, RS**  Right ascension. Equinox J2000.0
- **V, DG, DM, DS**  Declination. Equinox J2000.0
- **Bmag** Photographic (blue) magnitude
- **Vmag** Visual magnitude
- **B-V** Difference of visual and blue magnitude
- **SB** Surface brightness (mag/arcmin2)
- **X, Y** Larger/smaller diameter ('). If only one value (a) is given, this refers to the maximum size.
- **PA** Position angle (Â°). The position angle is only relevant for galaxies, and given if possible.
- **Type** Type of object
- **z** Redshift (from NED or LEDA)
- **D(z)** Distance  derived from z (Mpc)
- **MD** Metric Distance (Mpc); from NED
- **PGC** PGC-number. Object listed in the Catalog of Principle Galaxies [22]
- **ID1 - ID11** Identifications; the last non-empty field contains remarks (if any)
