NGC-IC
======

About
-----

The Revised New General Catalogue and Index Catalogue contains and describes all objects from the original NGC/IC, compiled by Dreyer. Additionally, many new objects (named with extension letters) or companions are included, so the catalogues list alltogether 13957 entries.

All known data, cross-identifications and individual names are presented. The problems of existence, data quality and double or multiple entries are discussed. For all objects (except some open clusters and nebulae) precise positions are given for 2000.0. Around 12600 positions were determined using the Digital Sky Survey (DSS) and RealSky, also many magnitudes, sizes and position angles, so a great amount of the presented data is new.

The project presented on GitHub is currently a work in progress to make it available in an open data format. In the meantime a comprehensive explaination of the project and the source data is available at (this should be treated as the upstream source):

Permission was granted by Dr. Wolfgang Steinicke to make this data available in this form, on the condition use conditions and acknowlegments are maintained.
